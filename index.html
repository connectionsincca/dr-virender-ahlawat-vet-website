						<p data-animation="slide-in-up">
							I’m a veterinary surgeon based in Langley, BC, with 25+ years of experience and a deep passion for animal welfare. Over time, I’ve been fortunate to build trust within our community, dedicating myself to the health and happiness of every animal I treat. My approach is simple: I believe animals deserve the same level of care and compassion as humans, and I strive to bring that belief to life through skill, empathy, and innovation in my work.</br>

							While I’ve been recognized for my surgical expertise, what truly drives me is the opportunity to make a difference—not just in the clinic but beyond. I’m passionate about advocating for animal welfare, promoting responsible pet ownership, and supporting wildlife conservation. It’s been incredibly rewarding to connect with people who share this love for animals and to contribute to education and awareness in our community.</br>

							I also believe in giving back. Whether it’s volunteering for rescue efforts, mentoring aspiring veterinarians, or participating in outreach programs, I try to lead with kindness and integrity. These values are at the heart of who I am, both as a professional and as a member of this community.
